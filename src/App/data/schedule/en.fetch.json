But on practice, in production environment, things sometimes are not going ideally as they go in test lab.<br><br>In this talk I'm trying to summarize all our failure stories and tell you in details about what problems we are faced when using Patroni in our clients. In this talk you will know about exact problems that might occurr and how to manage them.

In rare cases, developers think about security but on the other hand, consumers think that developers would have taken care of it. We need to teach our developers to think about app security upfront and include security in their development lifecycle. And this is important to retain the consumer trust if you want to stay in this game for long.<br><br>Mobile application security is one of the primary concerns as the data residing within the app could put users at risk. Every single developer needs to have a basic understanding of application security. You need to understand why it is important not to log sensitive data. You need to understand why it is important to use proguard to avoid reverse engineering. And you must rethink about insecure data storage and much more.<br><br>If you are a developer who develops a mobile application, chances are that you would have never thought about security. You must have been busy all the time thinking about UI/UX, cool shiny buttons, and whatnot! But very often we forget to think about security. If you don't work with mobile app security on a daily basis, chances are that you might feel stuck when it comes to dealing with sensitive data that cannot be exposed to third parties.<br><br>Common vulnerabilities in mobile applications include architectural flaws, platform weakness, isolation and permission problems and of course application weakness! This talk is targeted to developers who are already developing mobile apps for Android or maybe plan to. This talk, however, assumes that you know how to build and deploy mobile apps.<br><br>The real question is, how do enterprise or individuals avoid security challenges to protect their mobile apps? Enterprise and Indie developers of today must comprehend the next-generation cybersecurity best practices to safeguard the mobile apps and data within. And this talk will give you a brief idea about how to implement secure practices for your next mobile apps, or if you have any, already, implementing them on your existing mobile app!<br><br>There is a number of best practices for your mobile app security, this talk will focus on a few of them. So after the end of this talk, you would be in the position to implement some of them and make your app more trustworthy. This talk will teach you how to ensure that you are writing a vulnerability-free code!<br><br>This talk will give a brief insight on the OWASP top 10 mobile app vulnerabilities and how not to have them inside your next billion $$$ app."

Developers are facing the challenge which technology to choose to implement microservices for a cloud native setting. Java Enterprise has been used for software solutions for a long time and its APIs are well-established in the ecosystem. However, is it possible to develop cloud native, service-meshed Java Enterprise applications that fulfill concerns such as scalability, resiliency, and telemetry — in an effective, manageable way?<br><br>This session shows how to implement service-meshed applications using Jakarta EE 8 and MicroProfile. We will develop a mesh of microservices, managed by Kubernetes and Istio. We’ll see why especially the Java Enterprise approach fits the concepts behind container orchestration and service meshes well. The session also includes how to integrate the required cross-cutting concerns, such as monitoring, tracing, or resiliency into our applications, where developers have to actively integrate technology themselves and where the platform supports us. Especially the cooperation between Jakarta EE and MicroProfile provides a potent technology. All of the time will be spent live-coding while explaining the concepts and solutions."

		"description": "We all know that a modern tester should have both analytical skills and basic knowledge of programming as well as soft skills. If we add experience in agile software development, we get an almost perfect candidate in the eyes of employers. However, what if one day your employer says:\r<br>\r<br>+ Our sensor has been recently working too short.<br>+ Please, do the battery life tests. <br>+ Current functionalities of our product will be enhanced soon. Please, write some tests for the embedded platform.<br>+ Clients are complaining about our system working too slowly. Please, prepare the testing environment for performance tests of microprocessor memory.<br><br>Nowadays, everything tends to deliver high-quality products in a continuous way. How to test an application for your customer with so many tools, equipment, and ecosystems combining HW, FW, mobile devices and complex backend architecture? Over the past few years, I've already gone three times through the transformation from \\QA Team\\ thinking to \\Dev/TestOps\\ mindset in IoT companies.<br><br>During my presentation, I'll show you how to implement a multi-node system (HW/FW/SW) in the environment of Continuous Integration and (finally) Continuous Delivery. I will start with a big picture of a centralized automated test environment. After that, all components will be separately analyzed to present possible solutions and implementations. I will also show how to involve manual testers and let actively participate in the environment evolution. All of that supported by Jenkins tool, Python language, BDD approach and some HW knowledge."

		"description": "No one knows where it came from, but it is spreading like a disease: blocking paste functionality on online password forms. There is no explanation, no research, just a typical “this is for your security…”. And yet, all this is in the age of almost defeating the threat of weak and reused passwords by adopting password managers.<br><br>Some try to fight back: Firefox, for example, allows users to disable the block by completely turning off paste notifications. However, this is like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer, as there may be many other legitimate use-cases for sites to handle paste events.\r<br>\r<br>There are also some browser plugins: they go as far as scanning the whole DOM and removing the blocker code or injecting passwords directly into the page. But these come not without risks: unveiling passwords and full browsing history to third-party applications (which, by the way, have full network access). Also, users are limited in the choice of their browser, as these plugins are often not portable.\r<br>\r<br>It feels a bit wrong when a website (or anyone else) decides what users can or cannot do on their computers. However, there is hope: instead of fighting paste blockers, why not just provide the password in the “natural” way they expect—by typing it in. But the typing will be done by the user’s operating system, rather than the user himself: the OS can automatically type a very complex password from any password manager for you. And paste blockers can never block it—because this is the only way they should allow the password to get in, by design. These ‘Paste Wars’ are over: introducing a simple tool, which can type in complex passwords and restore users’ rights to paste!"

Thousands of them, maybe even hundreds of thousands. <br><br>But there is a huge piece of dark matter - why is it hard to read some programs? The work fast, well-formatted and commonly use best practices, but it is hard to read them, physiologically (and also psychologically) hard. In most cases, when you want to stop reading the code and take some break it is not procrastination but someone's bad-done job. <br><br>It sounds obvious that the code that we write should be comfortable to read and a lot of those best practices try to take this into account, but the focused on different things. Most of the programmers didn`t even think about their code as literature.<br><br>So, let's think about it. Why someone writes code like Fridrich Nitsche and why someone writes like Kenneth Grahame? Why some code as sophisticated as tax law and other as clear as a fifth-grade essay? Why some code makes you cry before you find a bug and why some code logical as subway map(well... some subway maps)?<br><br>Encephalograms to make you feel your self as a scientist included."

As well as many applications in finance, organic chemistry and complex dynamical systems there is an ugly elephant in the room. That elephant is Shor's algorithm.<br><br>Given a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, Shor's algorithm can factorise numbers in polynomial time. I have implemented it on a quantum simulator and it has been used on real quantum computers. When quantum computers are powerful enough nearly all the encryption techniques that we currently rely on will be useless.<br><br>The time is still far off when RSA will be useless but I will share some compelling reasons why we need to be taking action right now to avoid potential catastrophe in the not too distant future."
